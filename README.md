# **DISCLAIMER:**
This script was made purely as a proof of concept and should never be used maliciously. If it works as intended, there is no easy way to kill the script from running in the background and you will have to kill it by using Task Manager. This is a three-part script intended to set the system volume to max and continuously open Google Chrome tabs at a given interval with YouTube playing the popular music video of the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley. Please notice that echo is off, so there will be no visible command prompt window to kill the process. You must use Task Manager.
 
Please use at your own risk, and do not maliciously infect others who did not give prior consent. I will not be responsible for **ANY** harm potentially caused by the use of these scripts.
Proceed with caution.
